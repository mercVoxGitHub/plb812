-Read counts were generated from a an unstranded library.

-Number of reads per gene were counted using featuerCounts:

	"featureCounts -T 10 -s 0 -t exon --extraAttributes gene_id,gene_biotype -a /mnt/home/kusiapp2/gitHub/plb812/data/araport11/Phytozome/PhytozomeV12/early_release/Athaliana_447_Araport11/annotation/Athaliana_447_Araport11.gene_exons.gtf -o /mnt/home/kusiapp2/gitHub/plb812/data/alignments/AThaliana_assignment4/readResults/readCount.txt *.bam
	"

- pheatmap, RColorBrewer, DESeq2, ggplot2, affy and ggfotify R packages were installed and loaded

-a metadata csv file of column header "SampleID" and "Condition" was created

-Read count and metadata was imported into R using:

	"metadatah = read.csv(file= "metadata2.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
	counts <- read.csv("readCount.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
	"

-Deseq object was created using:

	"dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = round(countdata),
                              	colData = metadatah,
                              	design = ~Condition)
	"

-Genes with low counts were removed using:

	"dds1 <- dds[ rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10, ]
	"

-Read counts were normalized using:

	"vst = vst(dds1, blind=FALSE)
	"

-Differential Expression Analysis was done using:

	"dds1 <- DESeq(dds1)
	"

-MAPlot was constructed using:

	"plotMA(res_table)
	"

-p-value was adjusted using:

	"res2 <- results(dds1, alpha=0.05)
	"

-The number of differently expressed genes with a p-value of 0.05 was determined using:

	"sum(res2$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)
	"

- 14 genes were identified.
