> Protein sequences were downloaded

	and decompressed

	"gzip -d insertFileName.gz"

	then renamed

	"mv insertFileName.fa simplerFileName.fa"

> OrthoFinder was used to analyse the protein sequences as:

	"orthofinder -f /mnt/home/kusiapp2/gitHub/plb812/data/ortho"

> Number of Orthogroups identified was 17407 by using

	"cat N0.tsv | wc -l"

> Rice genes part of the orthogroup for Chalcone Synthase(AT5G13930) was identified using:

	"grep AT5G13930 N0.tsv > results.txt"
